Help Milena Create a Bookstore

Milena has just landed a deal to sell books from a foreign publisher and the capitalist in her is flaming to get the business going!
However, Milena is a .NET developer and she’s not very experienced in the .NET stack, so she developed a .NET Web API
but missed to put response models for some of the requests. She also wants to create a front-end application, however,
she has no idea how HTML, CSS and JS work.

But help is on the way!

You, the front-end engineer, have to develop an Angular 4 application
that uses her API (http://milenabooks.azurewebsites.net/Help)  to:

- List all the books //DONE :)
- Create a book //DONE :)
- Delete a book //DONE :)
- Edit a book. //DONE :) 
- BONUS: View book details //DONE :)

- BONUS BONUS Tasks:
- List all stores //DONE :)
- Select a store’s books //DONE :)
- Filter books by store


Upload the project on Github when it is ready.


That’s all  - the only conditions are to use Angular 4, the API given to you and to have
the functionalities listed. The rest is up to you.
